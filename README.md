# Community Pulse - Empowering Civic Engagement in Nigeria

## 🚀 Project Overview
Community Pulse is a civic-tech web application designed to revolutionize community reporting and accountability across Nigeria. It serves as a transparent and collaborative platform where citizens can document local issues, engage in petitions, and encourage action from both government bodies and local communities.

## 🎯 Why This Project
Nigeria, like many African nations, faces deep-rooted challenges of corruption, poor infrastructure, social neglect, and low governmental responsiveness. In many communities, everyday citizens no longer believe their voices matter—leading to widespread apathy and resignation.

**Community Pulse is created to change that.**

This project seeks to revive civic participation and social responsibility—not just by highlighting governmental failures, but by making community members accountable too. It promotes visibility, transparency, and collective responsibility for issues affecting the average Nigerian.

From street-level complaints about bad roads or extortion to state-level petitions on failed policies, this app will create a real-time map of civic voices that cannot be ignored.
